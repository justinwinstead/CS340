**How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?**

In order to write maintainable, readable, and adaptable software, I start by researching the requirements for the project at hand. After this, I create a basic outline for the functionality of the program. Next, I develop the program and test it against the requirements for the project. By being diligent and thorough, I was able to utilize my CRUD module to interface with the dashboard for Project 2 without much difficulty. This approach made further development much easier to complete. I should be able to utilze this CRUD module to develop another dashboard with a different user interface, in the future. 

**How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?**

I try to approach computer science problems with thoroughness and diligence. I attempt to decompose the problems that I am tasked with into a set of cohesive requirements. Then, I utilize these requirements to create and test a program that functions adequately. My approach to the project itself did not differ much from my typical approach. However, I have embraced the use of the command line and Linux to perform a lot of my programming tasks. I am sure to use this experience in future endeavors. 

**What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?**

Computer scientists leverage computers to assist themselves and the general public more adequately perform tasks. The software created by computer scientists has become essential to the daily function of society and we have an obligation to the public to create quality programs. The work that I completed would help Grazioso Salvare find search-and-rescue dogs more quickly and easily than ever before. They will no longer have to deal with complex database queries and can focus on training their animals.
